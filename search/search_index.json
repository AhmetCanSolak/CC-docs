It is a software to control your custom microscopes. Motivation There were only vendor specific software pieces to control microscopes and those were not satisfying for especially researchers of this field. Hence, we come up with ClearControl to address this issue. Fundamental Features It has an intuitive GUI to increase accessibility among people with different backgrounds. GUI Picture here It is modular and extendable. If ClearControl does not support a hardware you have you can easily wrap vendor drivers and use it within ClearControl. It is performant in a very unexpected way. It uses coremem and OpenCL under the hood. There is also a version for lightsheet microscopes. Check ClearControl-Lightsheet for details.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"Docs/intro/#what-is-clearcontrol","text":"It is a software to control your custom microscopes.","title":"What is ClearControl?"},{"location":"Docs/intro/#motivation","text":"There were only vendor specific software pieces to control microscopes and those were not satisfying for especially researchers of this field.
