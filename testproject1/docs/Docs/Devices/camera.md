# Camera

We have three different implemented cameras for now. These are hamamatsu camera,
simulated one and an usb camera.

## Hamamatsu Stack Camera

This is the ones we are using. Working well.

## Simulated Stack Camera

This is a simulated camera device. It is very useful for debugging purposes.

## USB Camera

This is not really implemented yet.
